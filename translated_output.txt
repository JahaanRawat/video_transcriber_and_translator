大家好，Jennie又出新妆容了。有没有刷到最近Jennie出电台的这个妆容，慵懒的小猫眼线，配上这种日杂的腮红感，咱们就说太迷人了。我发现现在韩妆真的很流行这种慵懒感，所以今天咱们也来上手画一把，看一下。她的眼珠子我感觉就属于那种非常赞的黑瞳，啊，感觉这个跟她那个眼珠就很像。但是先来遮盖一下我的黑眼圈，少量多次去叠加就好了。然后像眼尾勾勾这里的暗沉，咱们可以稍微给它拍一拍。它整体的肤色呢也是偏那种自然寡的小麦色，所以粉底液我来选这个色号是1N，把它平铺在咱们的脸上。属于妆型的粉底液，咱们就需要粉扑去上妆，快速用粉扑给它拍开。整体底妆的话就清透自然一点就可以了。嗯，超级beauty的。啊，这个妆效真好看。遮瑕的话用的还是这个，拿这个刷子点戳一下就可以了。第一次觉得我这个遮瑕液的颜色白了。然后整体的鼻子是比较直挺的，咱们就从这边开始。鼻子也是那种圆钝可爱型。山根这里呢稍微来一点点。好，像是我们肿眼泡的话，眼尾这里可以画一个微，因为它有点吊起，整体用就这样，哈哈哈，像个小勾子一样。这样这样点戳晕染就可以了。眼尾的地方稍微往上提一点，形成丝般形的轮廓感给它修饰出来。它整体的面部还是比较窄的，像我的话因为虽然说嘟了脸，下巴延长之后有点偏长脸，但是面部这一块是比较宽的，所以要把变窄，那么颧骨这里就要给它加重一点修容。然后包括眼下这个位置，因为我有很明显的大小眼，这里我要给它收紧，包括面部褶皱度，眉峰这里我们给它增加一点。然后拿出刚刚粉底液的粉扑，就这样吹着去拍就可以了，这能够很好的融合咱们的底妆。这样新手的话，我更建议大家如果想画这样的妆容，就可以妆前去使用这种高倍液体会比较方便一些，用粉的话很容易就是定妆，没定牢，容易结块。虽然红色它是比较偏那种，鱼中调的，咱还是来用霞飞的这款01，我感觉跟它上面颜色还挺类似。八，三三丹丹。开一个新的瑕粉扑。底妆呢疯狂动物城那个豹子经常会喜欢这种甜甜圈那种感觉，嘿嘿。腮红腮红，我们先去把鼻翼两侧先给它突出出来，然后在慢慢过度到面中的部分，像这样横向去画，就能更好去缩窄咱们中庭，跟咱们的修容去撞好做一个小小衔接。然后它的眼部颜色呢也比较统一，所以我们还是用这个颜色，稍微去按压一下咱们的眼皮，包括眼下这个地方给它稍微带一下。现在我就很像那种刚晒完回来感觉。打完这个腮红之后你就会发现面中这一块没有那种层刺感，就没有那种腮红的横向感，所以这个时候咱们就用到提亮液，一点点量，打在泪沟这个地方，和法令纹这里就可以了，然后如果说你额头这里不太突出的话可以稍微来一点。那像这样就可以了。包括眼尾这个地方，咱们稍微来眼部让它提起来，如果量比较多的话可以过度一下到我们眼下的这个地方。啊，这种横向感就出来了，很明显。稍微如果说有些缺的地方可以用刚刚粉扑上的那个鱼亮腮红稍微再点按一下。这样的话有明有暗，咱们层次感就出来了，直接来用这种中性色粉扑蘸取这个肤色粉底，就跟我的粉底液颜色大差不差。那么像是Jennie的眉毛呢就是那种毛茸茸的雾感，所以我们先来用这种深棕色，稍微打个底，然后再去用这种棕色的眉笔，我们稍微延长一下我们的眉尾，这种平柳眉，咱们就平柳眉画出来就可以了，因为她整体这个眉毛颜色会稍微有点深，所以我们再来用一点这种杏色的染眉膏，稍微给它刷一下，让颜色没有那么深以外，还能增加一下整体的这种毛流。然后发现其实她本身画眼妆很少会去用很多色彩，所以我们这样打完底之后直接来用一个深色的眼影先去用这种比较粗的这种眼线刷，先去定型。然后在慢慢往上去搂，去过度，再用一点这种棕色，需要边缘给它过度一下，凸显出一点点层次感。然后像我的话眼睛是属于比较短的，所以眼尾这里呢我们可以稍微给它加长一些，延长出来一些。整体呢也是有一点下眼线的，当然眼线呢不是颜色不是狠深，所以用那种浅棕色稍微去加深一下就可以了。然后像后半段我们稍微给它晕晕晕出来，然后像我们这样画出那种小猫眼线，就可以用这种多孔刷子蘸取这个深棕色，我们把后半段这个地方给它加粗一点。然后我看她的睫毛就是前半段是属于非常正常的自然寡，然后尾部的时候是带有点小弧度的那个感觉，就那种吊式的的感觉。所以我们前半段来贴这种非常自然寡的睫毛，就有点像模拟我们自然睫毛的那种感觉。后半段我们来贴这种弧形睫毛，其实睫毛上面，就拉长我们的睫毛，像这样很吊细的感觉。嗯，再拿我们的深棕色眼影稍微给它延长一下，下眼睑的地方，衔接的更加自然一些，最后再用眼皮，这个眼影盘里面这个亮片，我们稍微给它点缀一点点在眼皮上就行。这个眼妆还是很简单，啊，这个眼妆真的无敌放大看着，好，我再涂一下口红，嗯，因为它是比较偏那种红棕色，啊，我们再用一下这个。然后我们再把全部给它晕染，因为这样没冲突，嗯，好看好看。脖子待会稍微来弄一下我的发型什么的，精致一下吧。

=== TRANSLATION (ENGLISH) ===

Hello everyone! Jennie has a new makeup look.  Have you seen the makeup she wore on her recent radio appearance?  The languid cat-eye liner paired with that Japanese-magazine-style blush is just captivating.  I've noticed this languid look is really trending in Korean makeup, so today we're going to try it out.  Her eyes, I think, are those incredibly striking dark pupils – ah, this makeup really suits her eye color. But first, let's cover up my dark circles.  Apply it in thin layers.  Then, for the dullness at the corners of my eyes, we can gently pat it. Her overall skin tone is a natural, slightly muted wheatish color, so I'll use shade 1N foundation.  I'll apply it evenly to my face.  For this kind of foundation, we use a powder puff to apply and quickly pat it in.  The overall base makeup should be light and natural.  Ah, so beautiful!  The effect is amazing.  For concealer, I'll use this same one and just dab it on with this brush.  For the first time, I feel like this concealer is a bit too light. Her nose is quite straight and refined, so we'll start from here. It's a cute, round-tipped nose.  I'll add just a touch of contour to the bridge of my nose. Okay, for those of us with puffy eyes, we can draw a slight upward curve at the outer corner of the eye. It gives a slightly lifted look, like a little hook, haha! Just dab and blend it out. Lift the outer corner of the eye slightly to create a subtle, elegant contour. Her face is relatively narrow. Mine, although I'm puffing my cheeks, is a bit longer after extending my chin, and the face is wider, so to make it look narrower, we need to add more contour to the cheekbones. This includes under the eyes. Since I have noticeable differences in eye size, I need to contour this area to make it appear tighter, including the facial creases.  We'll also add a little definition to the brow bone. Then, take the foundation puff and gently pat it on. This helps blend the base makeup well.  For beginners, if you want to create this look, I recommend using a high-hydration primer beforehand; using powder alone can easily lead to caking if the base isn’t set properly. Although this red is a bit more orange-toned, we’ll still use this one by  [Brand Name], number 01. I feel like the color is quite similar.  Let's get a fresh powder puff. For the base makeup, I think of that leopard from Zootopia who loves donuts. Hehe. Blush, blush! First, let’s emphasize the sides of the nose, then gradually blend it towards the center of the face. Applying it horizontally like this helps to narrow the center of the face, creating a subtle connection with the contouring. Her eye makeup is quite uniform in color, so we'll use this same color and gently press it onto the eyelids and slightly under the eyes. Now I look like I just came back from sunbathing! After applying blush, you’ll notice the center of the face lacks harsh lines and there's no horizontal stripe from the blush. That's where we use highlighter. A small amount on the tear troughs and nasolabial folds is enough. If your forehead isn’t very prominent, you can add a little there.  That's good enough. Including the outer corners of the eyes. Let's lift them slightly. If you use too much, you can blend it down towards the under-eye area.  Ah, that horizontal highlight is really noticeable. If there are any areas that look lacking, you can dab on a little more of that peachy blush with the puff. This creates light and shadow, giving it dimension.  Now let's use a neutral-toned powder puff to apply a foundation powder that matches my foundation. Jennie’s eyebrows are fluffy and hazy, so we’ll use a dark brown to create a base, then a brown eyebrow pencil to slightly extend the tails, creating a flat, straight brow shape. Since her eyebrows are a bit darker, we’ll use an apricot-colored brow mascara to brush them lightly, softening the color and adding texture.  She doesn't use a lot of color in her eye makeup, so after creating the base, we’ll use a dark eyeshadow with a thick eyeliner brush to define the shape.  Then we’ll gently blend it upwards. Then, use a little brown to soften the edges and add some dimension.  Since my eyes are relatively short, I’ll extend the outer corners a bit. There's also a little lower lash line, but it's not very dark, so I'll use light brown to define it slightly. For the latter half, we’ll softly blend it out. To create the cat-eye look, use a multi-hole brush to apply dark brown and thicken the outer half. Her eyelashes are natural and sparse in the front, and slightly curved towards the ends, kind of a lifted look. So, we’ll apply natural-looking lashes to the front, mimicking our natural lashes. For the latter half, we’ll use these curved lashes to lengthen them, creating that lifted effect.  Let's use the dark brown eyeshadow to extend it slightly to the lower eyelid for a more seamless blend. Finally, let's use the shimmer from this eyeshadow palette and apply a touch to the eyelids. This eye makeup is really simple, and it makes the eyes look so much bigger! Okay, I'll put on some lipstick. It's a reddish-brown shade, so I’ll use this one.  Then we'll blend it all together to avoid any clashing. It's beautiful!  Later, I'll do my hair and neck to add some final touches.
